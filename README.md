# LearnGithub
A repo for learning and testing various GitHub features.

GitHub can be intimidating for new users, but by using simple non-programming examples the essentials can be learned very quickly.

## Preliminaries

Create a personal GitHub account.  Create a new remote repository named LearnGithub.

Download GitHub Desktop, so you can use the GUI interface and avoid typing directly GitHub commands.

Open the repository in GitHub Desktop.

## Getting Started

Edit the README.md file - add a little text to get started.

Let's start with a few files for a new website.

Locally, I'll create a new HTML file named index.htm in my folder Github\LearnGithub. Then copy that file to create three web pages named red.html, green.html, and blue.html. Open GitHub Desktop and the three new files should be visible. They are not yet a part of the project.

Add the required Summary description of the changes, then click the Commit to Master button. GitHub Desktop now knows that these files are part of the project.

Then, click the Push to Origin button.

View the remote repository LearnGitHub in your browser.  The three new files should be visible.

Next, edit the local file index.htm and add links to the three HTML files.  When finished, add the required Summary, then click the Commit to Master button, then click the Push to Origin button.

View the remote repository LearnGitHub in your browser.  The file index.html should now contain the three links.

## Creating a Branch

Now its time to add images to our web pages. For this task, we want to create a new branch for that task that can be assigned to a coworker.
